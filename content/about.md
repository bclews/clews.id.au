**Hey! I'm Ben Clews, a software engineer calling Hobart, Tasmania home.**

I spend my days turning complex tech challenges into elegant solutions, currently as a Cloud System Engineer at CSIRO's Data61. We're building some cool stuff that helps researchers manage their data and run powerful analytics - basically making it easier for science to make a real impact.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hunting out new music, whisky and craft chocolate (yes, probably in that order). I brew small batches of beer, attempt to bake bread (with varying success), and love exploring new cities with my camera in hand.
