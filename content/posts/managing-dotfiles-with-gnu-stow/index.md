Dotfiles can be a pain to manage when they’re scattered across your home directory. In the past, I used a bare Git repo approach based on [StreakyCobra’s setup on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797). It worked well but had its limitations - like needing a custom alias for Git commands (which I’d often forget) and some tricky troubleshooting when configs broke.

Recently, though, I switched to using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) after reading [Brandon Invergo’s guide](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html). Stow is a simple symlink manager originally for managing software installed from source. The beauty of Stow is that it keeps all dotfiles neatly organized in one directory and links them to where they need to be, which keeps your home directory clean and makes version control easier.

I’ve set up my own [dotfiles repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bclews/dotfiles) using this method. With Stow, you can simply clone the repo, run `stow` on the config directories you want to use, and you’re all set with symlinks pointing to the correct locations. This method is clean, straightforward, and doesn’t require remembering custom commands.

For anyone tired of dotfile chaos, I highly recommend giving GNU Stow a shot!
