Recently, I’ve been making a conscious effort to eliminate lazy practices from my workflow—the kind of 'temporary' workarounds that sneak in during crunch time and somehow become permanent habits. My latest offender? A convoluted method for building containers on remote machines. Instead of using a branch like any reasonable person (for reasons I can’t even justify), I’d generate a git patch locally, SCP it to the remote machine, apply it there, and then build. It’s the software equivalent of taking the scenic route while ignoring the perfectly good highway right in front of me.

Eventually, it dawned on me: the [Kubernetes command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) (`kubectl`) has contexts that enable you to easily switch between clusters and namespaces, so Docker probably does too. Sure enough, it does. Below are notes on how Docker’s SSH integration and context management has simplified my remote build process.

### The Magic of Docker over SSH

Using Docker over SSH allows you to manage remote Docker hosts securely without exposing their Docker API to the network. By setting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to an SSH connection string (`ssh://username@remote_host`), you can run Docker commands locally while they execute on the remote machine.

#### Example: Run Commands on a Remote Host

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://username@remote_host
docker ps  # Lists containers on the remote machine
```

You can also specify the `DOCKER_HOST` inline for a single command:

```bash
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://username@remote_host docker images
```

### Simplify Switching with Docker Contexts

While `DOCKER_HOST` works well for ad-hoc commands, Docker contexts offer a more robust solution for managing multiple environments. A context defines a connection configuration (e.g., local or remote hosts) and lets you switch seamlessly between them.

#### Creating a Remote Context

```bash
docker context create my-remote-context --docker "host=ssh://username@remote_host"
```

#### Using Docker Contexts

- **List all contexts:** `docker context ls`
- **Switch to a context:** `docker context use my-remote-context`
- **Return to the default context:** `docker context use default`

With a remote context active, every Docker command you run will target the specified remote host.

### Building Images Remotely

One of the most powerful use cases for Docker over SSH is building images remotely using your local source code. This is particularly useful for resource-intensive builds or when targeting specific architectures.

#### How It Works

When you run `docker build` with a remote host, Docker transfers your local build context (the files and directories in your build directory) to the remote machine. The Docker daemon on the remote host then builds the image.

#### Example: Building Remotely

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

With `DOCKER_HOST` or a Docker context pointing to the remote machine, the build occurs remotely, and the resulting image is stored on the remote host.

#### Tips for Efficient Builds

- **Minimise the Build Context:** Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the build context, reducing transfer time.
- **Check Remote Images:** Verify the build by listing images on the remote host:

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

### Practical Benefits of Docker Over SSH

1. **Offload Resource-Intensive Builds**
   Free up your local machine by running builds on a powerful remote server. This is ideal for large datasets, complex Dockerfiles, or compute-heavy tasks like machine learning models.

2. **Streamline CI/CD Pipelines**
   Centralise builds in a remote environment to manage dependencies and cache image layers efficiently. With Docker contexts, CI/CD tools can easily target staging or production environments.

3. **Cross-Architecture Support**
   Need an ARM image for IoT devices? Build directly on a remote ARM machine using `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://...`.

4. **Secure, Compliant Builds**
   Keep sensitive data and build artifacts confined to specific locations, ensuring compliance with data sovereignty requirements.

### Setting Up for Success

Here are some best practices to make the most of Docker over SSH:

- **Use SSH Keys for Authentication:** Set up passwordless access for secure and seamless connections.
- **Test Connectivity First:** Verify that your SSH connection works (`ssh username@remote_host`) before configuring Docker.
- **Limit Permissions:** Configure restricted SSH and Docker permissions on remote hosts to protect against unauthorised access.
- **Optimise `.dockerignore`:** Exclude large or unnecessary files from the build context to minimise upload times.

### Wrapping Up

Docker over SSH and context management can improve your workflow, replacing cumbersome, error-prone methods with secure, efficient, and scalable solutions. Whether you’re managing a single remote machine or orchestrating a multi-host setup, these tools enable smooth and reliable operations.

So next time you’re tempted to take the scenic route with your Docker builds, remember: the highway’s right there.
