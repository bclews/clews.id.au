This is a test TIL to verify that the new Today I Learned section is working correctly!

## What I Learned

- TILs use a separate content type from posts
- They have a distinctive 💡 icon
- They appear in their own section on the homepage
- They share tags and categories with posts

## Why This Matters

Quick, informal learning notes help document small discoveries and make knowledge sharing easier.
